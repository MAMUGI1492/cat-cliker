# Animated Gifs - _CSS Layout_

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/a560f842-9159-41c2-9e85-33bf4c2aa882/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/animated-gifs-stylesage/deploys)

## DEMO

[animated-gifs-stylesage.netlify.app](https://animated-gifs-stylesage.netlify.app/)

## Description

In this test I have given priority to the layout without the use of [Quasar](https://quasar.dev/)'s own components (in the end what is sought is to see these abilities, not to copy - paste the different components.

Due to the confidentiality restrictions imposed for this exercise, the _gifs.json_ file has not been uploaded to the repository, so when accessing the demo, the gifs and texts of the fallback created for the occasion will be loaded.

## Desirable enhancements

With a little more time, I would have added a couple of extra features:

- Automatic themes, with the possibility of being changed manually by the user (including the dark theme).
- Multilanguage system (with at least English).
